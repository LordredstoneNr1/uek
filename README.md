# UEK - Universe Enhancement Kit
_The Universe Enhancement Kit: A Chrome Extension for the League of Legends Universe_

The goal of this project is to provide a feature that has often been requested: Progress Tracking and Reading Lists.
It is designed to be lightweight and fast, using pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

* Features include:
  * Manage lists of stories: Either all of them or only specific ones, e.g. only stories set in Shurima.
  * Sort and search by title, release date, authors, champions or regions
  * Context Menu for easy access
