# UEK - Universe Enhancement Kit
_The Universe Enhancement Kit: A Chrome Extension for the League of Legends Universe_

Abandoned personal project. I still use this as overview for Universe, but cut a lot of features like lists and heavily taylored it to my own needs.

Features:
  * Sort and filter all stories on Universe by 
	* Title
	* Release Date 
	* Authors
	* Champions
	* Regions
	* Length
  * Pre-defined reading lists and the option to create and share your own lists
  * Extract images from story backgrounds or links
